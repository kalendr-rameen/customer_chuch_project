# Customer_chuch_project

Clients began to leave Beta Bank. Every month. Not much, but noticeable. The bank's marketing experts figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones.
We need to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. We are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.
Construct a model with an extremely high value of F1-measure. To pass the project successfully, you need to bring the metric to 0.59. Test F1-measure on the test sample by yourself.
Additionally measure AUC-ROC, compare its value with F1-measure.
